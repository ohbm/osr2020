For the first time in OHBM and OSR history, we will be broadcasting all the scheduled OSR material live to anyone who would like to tune in!

# Where will you be watching from?!

We'd love to see where you are watching from! We'd also love to help your colleagues find you so you can watch the action in the OSR together, and share the experience!

If you would like to let us know about your watch party, please add it to the above [open map](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D1GeMmfc14zmYXt9059h5-op8n8x72mq&usp=sharing). Simply search for your location and click `Add to Map` then the pencil icon to `Edit` the details. In the details please provide:
1. Your contact name and email address;
2. The time and date for any events;
3. A link to a webpage advertising your event, if available.

If there is a watch party near you which you would like to join, please contact the organiser!

We know that timezones might make a live connection prohibitive, but you may still like to watch the feed at a designated time or place. Please feel free to add yourself to the map even if you are not watching live!

Whether you are watching by yourself or having a party, you will find some useful information [below](#how) about how to connect to the broadcast and other essentials.

<div id='questions'></div>
## How to ask questions

Youtube comments during the talks - may be a delay of a few minutes in the broadcast, so do not wait until the end to ask questions - ask as soon as you think of them!

And on twitter @OhbmOpen #OHBM #OSR #WatchParty &lt;need to think of a way of identifying each talk.?&gt;

On mattermost - general chat about remote participation. &lt;needs a new channel&gt;
