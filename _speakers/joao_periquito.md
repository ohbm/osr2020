Pronouns: They/them
Job: Researcher
Affiliation: Max Delbrueck Center, Berlin, Germany
ShortBio: 'João is currently finishing his PhD at Berlin Ultrahigh Field Facility
  (B.U.F.F.), Berlin, Germany. His research is focused on development of new diagnosis
  techniques for renal MRI. Open source invaded his heart when he realized that he
  did not need to spend one year implementing an algorithm because someone kind went
  the extra mile and published a well-documented open-source tool that others can
  use to their purposes. João is also involved in the project: Open Source Imaging
  Initiative (OSI²), a creative community of volunteers with the aim of facilitating
  medical devices to more people all around the world.'
